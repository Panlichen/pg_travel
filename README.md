Implement [deeprm](http://people.csail.mit.edu/hongzi/content/publications/DeepRM-HotNets16.pdf), which
is initially implemented [here](https://github.com/hongzimao/deeprm), 
to suit the code structure used in [pg_travel](https://github.com/reinforcement-learning-kr/pg_travel).  
<br>
Usage:<br>
`python3 main.py [options]`<br>

TODO: 
- make the env more down-to-earth 
- integrate kubernetes features
- use more sophisticated and specific model and algorithm
